For this exercise, I chose to greate a simple GUI which allows the user to easily understand and communicate with the program. 
This application allows the user to add the information required to calculate a quote for their clients.

I wanted to create something that is nearly foolproof - in school we were taught to leave little to no room for dicrepencies 
from the users. The simplicity of the GUI removes potential confusion from the user, when the task at hand is a simple one. 

If I were to do the exercise another way, I might consider creating a webapp with even more embellished asthetics. I would also consider
splitting up the code if it were a larger task. For example, I would create a seperate class for the frame, and instantiate it in the main
method as opposed to creating it inside all one class. I like java's object-oriented abilities, so if I were to do the project another way,
I would try to include more of that.
